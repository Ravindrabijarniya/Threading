# Threading Examples in Java

This project demonstrates different threading approaches:
- **SingleThreading**
- **MultiThreading**  
- **ThreadPool**  

## 📁 Structure

├── SingleThreading/ → Sequential execution
├── MultiThreading/ → Parallel threads
└── ThreadPool/ → Efficient thread reuse


📝 Notes
SingleThreading: Best for simple, sequential tasks.

MultiThreading: Improves performance for CPU-bound tasks.

ThreadPool: Optimizes resource usage for high-volume tasks.
